## 🔹 Introduction to Channels

### 🤔 What are Channels?

> **_A channel in Go is a typed conduit that allows goroutines to communicate with each other and synchronize execution by passing values._**

It’s part of Go’s CSP (**_Communicating Sequential Processes_**) model,
where goroutines don’t share memory directly; instead, they communicate by passing data through channels.

> 🧠 **Simple Idea**: Channels are like “pipes” that connect goroutines — one goroutine sends data into the pipe, and another receives it from the other end.

#### 👉 Real-world Analogy

Think of a channel like a message queue or pipeline:

- One goroutine is a worker that sends finished items into the pipe.
- Another goroutine is a receiver that takes those items out for further use.

> **NOTE 👉** You don’t need to worry about locks, mutexes, or shared memory — channels handle synchronization automatically!

### ❓ Why we need Channels ?

When multiple goroutines are running:

- They execute independently and asynchronously.

- There’s no built-in mechanism for one to know what another has done.

So we need a way to:

- Share results between goroutines.

- Coordinate execution safely (without data races).

- Synchronize (make one goroutine wait for another when necessary).

> **NOTE 👉** Channels provide all of this in a safe, elegant, and built-in way.

### 🧐 How channels synchronize goroutines

When you send or receive using a channel:

- Sending blocks until another goroutine is ready to receive.

- Receiving blocks until another goroutine sends a value.

This ensures synchronization automatically — you don’t have to manually coordinate timing.

##### When a goroutine sends (ch <- value):

- It pauses until another goroutine receives from that channel.

##### When a goroutine receives (val := <-ch):

- It pauses until some goroutine sends data into that channel.

Thus, both goroutines meet at the channel, ensuring proper sequence and synchronization.

### 🔗 Basic syntax and simple example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Step 1: Create a channel of type string
    ch := make(chan string)

    // Step 2: Start a goroutine that sends data
    go func() {
        ch <- "Hello from Goroutine!"
    }()

    // Step 3: Main goroutine receives data
    msg := <-ch
    fmt.Println(msg)
}
```

#### 🔀 Step-by-Step Flow

- ch := make(chan string) → creates a channel.

- A goroutine sends a message "Hello from Goroutine!".

- The main goroutine waits (blocks) at <-ch until data arrives.

- Once data is received, the main goroutine continues.

> **✅ Automatic synchronization** — no time.Sleep(), no mutex, no race.

## 🔹 Unbuffered vs Buffered Channels

### 🔎 Definition and difference

| Type                   | Definition                                                                               | Key Behavior                                                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unbuffered Channel** | Channel **without internal storage**. Data must be **sent and received simultaneously**. | Sender **blocks** until receiver is ready.                             |
| **Buffered Channel**   | Channel **with internal capacity** (buffer) that can hold limited values.                | Sender can send **without immediate receiver** — until buffer is full. |

### 💬 In Simple Words:

**Unbuffered Channel** → **_“handshake communication” 🤝_**

➤ Both goroutines must be ready at the same time.

**Buffered Channel** → **_“mailbox communication” 📬_**

➤ Sender drops a message in the box; receiver picks it up later.

### ⛔ Blocking behavior in both

#### ▶️ Unbuffered Channel

- Sender blocks until receiver receives.

- Receiver blocks until sender sends.

- There’s no storage in between.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Step 1: Create a channel of type int
    ch := make(chan int)
	defer close(ch)

    // Step 2: Start a goroutine that sends data
    go func() {
        ch <- 12  // blocks until main goroutine receives
    }()

    // Step 3: Main goroutine receives data
    fmt.Println(<-ch) // receives and unblocks sender
}
```

> 🔄 Communication happens only when both are ready.

#### ▶️ Buffered Channel

- Has a capacity (queue) defined at creation.
- Sender blocks only when buffer is full.
- Receiver blocks only when buffer is empty.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Step 1: Create a channel of type int
    ch := make(chan int, 2) // buffered with capacity 2
	defer close(ch)

	ch <- 10 // does NOT block (buffer has space)
	ch <- 20 // does NOT block (buffer still has space)
	// ch <- 30 // would block (buffer full)

	fmt.Println(<-ch) // receives first value
	fmt.Println(<-ch) // receives second value
}
```

### 📖 Use-cases

| Channel Type   | Use-Case                                                                       | Example                                             |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Unbuffered** | Strict synchronization — when you want both sender & receiver to meet exactly. | Worker signaling completion (like `done` channels). |
| **Buffered**   | Asynchronous communication — when sender should continue without waiting.      | Worker pools, pipelines, event queues.              |

## 🔹 Channel Directions

### 🤔 What Are Channel Directions?

By default, a Go channel is bidirectional — meaning it can be used for both sending and receiving data.
But Go also allows you to restrict the direction of a channel — making it send-only or receive-only.

These direction-restricted channels are used to enforce safe communication and clear ownership between goroutines.

### ⚙️ Channel Direction Types
| Type                      | Declaration | Meaning                                           |
|---------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Bidirectional Channel** | `chan T`    | Can both send and receive values of type `T`.     |
| **Send-only Channel**     | `chan<- T`  | Can only **send** values **into** the channel.    |
| **Receive-only Channel**  | `<-chan T`  | Can only **receive** values **from** the channel. |

### Bidirectional channels (chan T)

This is the **_default_** type returned when you create a channel using `make()`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	ch := make(chan int, 1) // Buffered bidirectional channel
	defer close(ch)

	ch <- 10        // Send
	value := <-ch   // Receive

	fmt.Println(value)
}
// Output:
// 10
```

Here, the same variable ch can send or receive values.

> **Typical Use** - When both the sender and receiver are in the same function, or when you want a general-purpose channel.

### Send-only channels (chan<- T) 

This channel can only send data, not receive.

If you try to receive from it, the compiler throws an error.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	ch := make(chan int) // unbuffered channel
	defer close(ch)
	
	go SendData(ch)
	
	fmt.Println("Received:", <-ch)
}

func SendData(ch chan<- int) {
	ch <- 42
	fmt.Println("Sent 42 to channel")
}

// Output:
// Sent 42 to channel
// Received: 42
```

#### ℹ️ Explanation:

- The `sendData()` function can only send data to the **channel**.
- It cannot accidentally receive data.
- This helps maintain clear communication direction and prevent misuse.

### Receive-only channels (<-chan T)

This channel can only receive data, not send.

If you try to send data to it, the compiler throws an error.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int)
	defer close(ch)
	go func() {
		ch <- 99
	}()
	ReceiveData(ch)
}

func ReceiveData(ch <-chan int) {
	val := <-ch
	fmt.Println("Received:", val)
}

// Output:
// Received: 99
```

### When and why to use direction-restricted channels

#### Reason 1️⃣: Enforce Communication Direction

When you design concurrent systems, you can prevent accidental misuse by defining whether a goroutine can send or receive.

> **Example**: A “producer” should only send; a “consumer” should only receive.

#### Reason 2️⃣: Improve Code Readability

Anyone reading your function signature knows exactly what the goroutine does.

```go
func producer(ch chan<- int)
func consumer(ch <-chan int)
```
It’s self-documenting — no need for extra comments.

#### Reason 3️⃣: Compiler-Level Safety

- Direction-restricted channels prevent bugs before runtime — ensuring that goroutines don’t perform unintended operations on channels.

#### Reason 4️⃣: Decouple Producer and Consumer Logic

- They allow you to pass the same channel through different parts of the program while restricting capabilities.
